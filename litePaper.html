            <div class="lpHeading">The Problem</div>
            <div class="lpText">Moon Marbles recognizes P2E games have limited potential
                of earnings upon how many assets a player may have. Ths makes it hard
                for the player with a small amount of ETH to be competitive. How many
                P2E Games have you seen allowing the "Small Fish" able to enlarge their 
                financial position just by sheer gaming skill?
            </div>
            <div class="lpHeading">The Solution</div>
            <div class="lpText">Our game allows even the smallest players to ourpace their
                competition and earn big by beating levels with skill. Along with skill,
                players can purchase one-time use items to help propel them through the 
                levels while they earn. Each marble will have the different gear to help
                them through the game limiting their need to buy items.<br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Advantage: Some marbles will eventually have gear equipped to
                        them 24/7 offering an advantage on overall game difficulty.
                    </li>
                    <li>Convenience: Gear and shop items make the levels easier to get 
                        through earning Moon Tokens along the way.
                    </li>
                <li>
                    Equipped: Depending on your gear you will be able to show off your marble
                    after "The Morphing" reducing supply by up to 90%.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Story: Each item and level will unfold a storyline. One that unravels
                    slowly greatly rewarding those who show the most patience.
